    /**
     Executes the [LPUSH](https://redis.io/commands/lpush) command.

     Insert all the specified values at the head of the list stored at key. If key does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operations. When key holds a value that is not a list, an error is returned.

     It is possible to push multiple elements using a single command call just specifying multiple arguments at the end of the command. Elements are inserted one after the other to the head of the list, from the leftmost element to the rightmost element.

     So for instance the command `LPUSH` mylist `a` `b` `c` will result into a list containing `c` as first element, `b` as second element and `a` as third element.

     - parameter key: The key of the list to add the elements to.
     - parameter values: The values to add to the list.

     - returns: The length of the list after the push operations.

     Executes the [RPOPLPUSH](https://redis.io/commands/rpoplpush) command.

     Atomically returns and removes the last element (tail) of the list stored at source, and pushes the element at the first element (head) of the list stored at destination.

     For example: consider source holding the list `a,b,c`, and destination holding the list `x,y,z`. Executing `RPOPLPUSH` results in source holding `a,b` and destination holding `c,x,y,z`.

     If source does not exist, the value `nil` is returned and no operation is performed. 
     If source and destination are the same, the operation is equivalent to removing the last element from the list and pushing it as first element of the list, so it can be considered as a list rotation command.
     
     - parameter source: The source list.
     - parameter destination: The destination list.

     - returns: The element being popped and pushed.

     `BRPOPLPUSH` is the blocking variant of `RPOPLPUSH`. When source contains elements, this command behaves exactly like `RPOPLPUSH`.
     
     When source is empty, Redis will block the connection until another client pushes to it or until timeout is reached. A timeout of zero can be used to block indefinitely.

     See `RPOPLPUSH` for more information.

     - count > 0: Remove elements equal to value moving from head to tail.
     - count < 0: Remove elements equal to value moving from tail to head.
     - count = 0: Remove all elements equal to value.
