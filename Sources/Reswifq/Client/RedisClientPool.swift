// MARK: - RedisClientPool

/**
 A `RedisClientPool` provides a pool of `RedisClient`s.

 It is important to notice that a `RedisClientPool` is a `RedisClient` itself, meaning that it can be transparently used as a `Queue`'s client.
 
 In fact, this is the recommended usage, but it is also mandatory when running a multi-threaded worker process.
 
 - Attention: Sharing a Redis connection between multiple threads must be avoided, and it's not supported in any way. A `RedisClientPool` must be use instead.
