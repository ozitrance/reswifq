     The type of the job.

     This is used during the deserialization to instruct the queue about what type of job it has to instantiate.

     A default implementation is provided that returns the type's name.
     For example, a class named `MyJob`:
     
     ```
     class MyJob: Job {

     }
     ```

     Will have a default type equal to: `MyJob`.

     - Attention: This value must match the key specified in the `Queue`'s `jobMap`, otherwise the job won't be deserialized correctly.
